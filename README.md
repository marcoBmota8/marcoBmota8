- 👋 Hi, I’m @marcoBmota8
- 👀 I’m interested in the application of machine learning and data science to healthcare. 
I am amazed by the potential that electronic health records can give to these new data-driven algorithms to improve teh way we care and treat and diganose diseases.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new ways of exploting image data in the context of MRI and MR elastography, but also how multimodal data can be use altogether to aid clinical decisions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects regarding biomedical and health informatics.
