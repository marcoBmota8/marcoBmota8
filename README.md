- 👋 Hi, I’m @marcoBmota8
- 👀 I’m interested in the application of machine learning and data science to healthcare. 
I am amazed by how big amounts of electronic health records, medical imaging, omic data, etc can leverage new data-driven algorithms to improve the way we care.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new ways of exploting unsupervised machine learning methods that can extract latent disease phenotypes from EHR data. Furthermore, My ultimate aim is to use this information to build multivariate regression models that can predict patient disease risk.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects regarding biomedical and health informatics.
