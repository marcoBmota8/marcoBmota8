- 👋 Hi, I’m @marcoBmota8
- 👀 I’m interested in the application of machine learning and data science to healthcare. 
I am amazed by how big amounts of electronic health records data, medical imaging, omic data, and other sources of information, can be leveraged through data-driven algorithms to improve the way we care.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects regarding biomedical and health informatics.
